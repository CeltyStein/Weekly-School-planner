DESCRIPTION:Critical Thinking Exercise: Automated Clinicians\n\nIt is the y
 ear 2024\, and robots are being introduced to handle the screening of pati
 ents at physicians' offices across the United States. The robots are human
  looking and are able to speak and understand English and Spanish. The rob
 ots are capable of performing basic nursing tasks\, such as taking a patie
 nt's vital signs. Upon arriving at a physician's office\, a patient would 
 meet with the robot to determine the patient's current conditions and symp
 toms and to review pertinent medical history from the patient's EHR. The r
 obot would form a preliminary diagnosis and suggest a course of action\, w
 hich could include additional tests\, medication\, referral to a specialis
 t\, or hospitalization. A human physician would then review the preliminar
 y diagnosis and suggested course of action. If necessary\, the physician w
 ould meet with the patient to confirm the robot's diagnosis and order any 
 additional work or medications that might be necessary. The robotic physic
 ian assistant can be made available 24 × 7 and can even be stationed at c
 onvenient locations\, such as shopping malls\, schools\, places of work\, 
 and college campuses. The goal of using of robotic physician assistants is
  to increase the number of patients that could be seen by a single physici
 an\, while also cutting patient wait time.\n\nYou are on the administrativ
 e staff of a large physician group that is among the first to introduce ro
 botic physician assistants. What sort of testing is necessary before the a
 utomated clinician can be certified as fit for use? What start-up issues m
 ight be expected? What would you do to make the use of a robotic physician
  assistant more acceptable to patients and to ensure patient care does not
  suffer?\n\nYour response needs to be a minimum of 2 complete paragraphs a
 nd must be submitted via microsoft word and is due Sunday by midnight.

DESCRIPTION:The Specialized Practical Role of the RSA Cryptosystem\n-------
 -----------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 7 introduces th
 e RSA cryptosystem\, stating that it was "for a long time the most popular
  asymmetric cryptographic scheme". However\, Section 7.1 clarifies that in
  practice\, RSA is "most often used for: encryption of small pieces of dat
 a\, especially for key transport\, [and] digital signatures". Drawing on i
 nformation from Sections 7.1 and 7.2\, discuss the implications of RSA's s
 pecialized practical uses.\n\nConsider the following in your response:\n\n
 * Based on Section 7.2\, the RSA encryption (y = xe mod n) and decryption 
 (x = yd mod n) operations involve "very long numbers\, usually 2048 bits o
 r more". How might the computational demands of operating with such large 
 numbers contribute to RSA being primarily used for "small pieces of data" 
 and "key transport" rather than for general bulk data encryption?\n\n* Giv
 en that RSA is also widely used for "digital signatures"\, how does this a
 pplication differ in its data processing needs compared to encrypting arbi
 trary messages\, and why might RSA be particularly well-suited for digital
  signing?\n\nYour initial post should be at least two paragraphs long\, wi
 th each containing four sentences. This is due by Friday at 11:59 PM. A mi
 nimum of three replies is due Sunday evening by 11:59 PM.\n\n \n\nWorks C

DESCRIPTION:Deconstructing RSA Key Generation\n----------------------------
 -----\n\nThe RSA cryptosystem\, while widely used\, relies on a meticulous
  key generation process that ensures its security and functionality. This 
 process involves several critical mathematical steps and parameters. Write
  an essay that elaborates on the key generation process for the RSA crypto
 system as described in Section 7.3.\n\nIn your essay\, be sure to:\n\n* Ex
 plain the purpose and significance of selecting two large prime numbers\, 
 p and q\, and how their product n forms the RSA modulus. Discuss briefly h
 ow the size of these primes (e.g.\, 1024 bits for p and q for a 2048-bit m
 odulus n) directly relates to the scheme's practical security against fact
 oring attacks.\n\n* Detail the calculation and role of Euler's totient fun
 ction\, Φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)\, within the key generation process.\n\n* Clari
 fy the critical condition gcd(e\, Φ(n)) = 1 for choosing the public expon
 ent e\, and precisely why this condition is absolutely necessary to guaran
 tee the existence of the private exponent d.\n\n* Briefly mention how d is
  computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to satisfy the modular in
 verse relationship d · e ≡ 1 mod Φ(n)\, without needing to show the al
 gorithmic steps\n\nYour essay should draw directly from both the provided 
 source material and external sources. Cite your work appropriately to supp
 ort your arguments and offer detailed explanations of the cryptographic co
 ncepts involved.  The assignment should be at a minimum of three pages an
 d in APA format.\n\nSubmit your work as either a Word Document or a PDF. E
 nsure you follow the rubric.

DESCRIPTION:Unpacking the Discrete Logarithm Problem: Foundations and Crypt
 analytic Approaches\n-----------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------\n\nThe Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) is p
 resented in Chapter 8 as a crucial one-way function underpinning the secur
 ity of numerous public-key algorithms\, including the Diffie–Hellman Key
  Exchange and Elgamal encryption.\n\n* Drawing on the concepts of abstract
  algebra from Section 8.2\, explain what constitutes a finite cyclic group
  and how a primitive element (also known as a generator) can generate all 
 elements within such a group.\n\n* Formally define the Discrete Logarithm 
 Problem (DLP) itself within this algebraic context\, stating the given inp
 uts and the desired output.\n\n* Then\, compare and contrast two distinct 
 classes of algorithms used to attack the DLP: one that is generic (applica
 ble to any finite cyclic group) and another that is nongeneric (exploits s
 pecific algebraic structures of the group). For each class\, describe its 
 underlying principle\, its general computational complexity\, and explicit
 ly state whether it applies to DLP instances in prime fields ([LaTeX: \\ma
 thbb{Z}_{p}^{*} ] (https://classes.iwcc.edu/equation_images/%255Cmathbb%25
 7BZ%257D_%257Bp%257D%255E%257B*%257D%2520?scale=1)) and/or elliptic curve 
 groups.\n\nYour essay should draw directly from both the provided source m
 aterial and external sources. Cite your work appropriately to support your
  arguments and offer detailed explanations of the cryptographic concepts i
 nvolved.  The assignment should be at a minimum of three pages and in APA
  format.\n\nSubmit your work as either a Word Document or a PDF. Ensure yo
 u follow the rubric.

 elect\, write a comprehensive\, well-structured essay of at least one full

  concepts presented in the first chapter of the provided text. The use of 
 external sources is encouraged\; however\, please review the policy on usi

 for all works used\, including the textbook.\n\nSubmit your assignment in 
 a single file\, using either a Word (.doc\, .docx) or PDF format.\n\n*\n\n
 Anatomy of an E-mail Investigation: Detail the process of tracing an e-mai
 l message back to its source. Explain the forensic significance of an e-ma
 il header\, including the information contained within it (IP addresses\, 
 ESMTP numbers\, etc.) and how investigators use network e-mail logs and on
 line lookup tools (like ARIN) to corroborate this information.\n\n*\n\nCli
 ent vs. Server E-mail Forensics: Compare the challenges and procedures for
  recovering e-mail evidence from a client computer versus an e-mail server
 . Discuss how e-mail storage (.pst files vs. server databases)\, logging c
 onfigurations (like circular logging)\, and access protocols (POP3 vs. IMA
 P4) affect the investigation.\n\n*\n\nSocial Media as a Source of Evidence
 : Discuss the growing role of online social networks (OSNs) like Facebook 
 and Twitter in both civil and criminal investigations. What types of evide
 ntiary information can be found on these platforms? Analyze the primary ch
 allenges investigators face\, including data volume\, jurisdictional issue
 s\, and the need for warrants or subpoenas to access non-public informatio
 n from vendors.\n\n*\n\nForensic Linguistics: Define forensic linguistics 
 and explain its application in an e-mail or social media investigation. Di
 scuss what a forensic linguist can and cannot determine from a piece of wr
 iting and how this analysis can be used as evidence to help authenticate (
 or dispute) the authorship of a message.\n\n*\n\nRecovering Deleted E-mail
 : Explain the different methods an investigator can use to recover deleted
  e-mail messages. Your answer should cover the use of specialized GUI tool
 s (like Magnet AXIOM)\, the manual process of carving messages from an mbo
 x format file using a hex editor\, and the function of utilities like scan
 pst.exe for repairing corrupted Outlook files.

DESCRIPTION:The RSA Digital Signature Scheme\n-----------------------------
 ---\n\nThe RSA digital signature scheme is a widely adopted method based o
 n public-key cryptography\, whose security relies on the hardness of the i
 nteger factorization problem.\n\n* Explain the step-by-step process of the
  "schoolbook" RSA digital signature protocol\, covering both how a message
  is signed by the sender and how the signature is verified by the receiver
 . Clearly articulate the role of the private and public keys in this proce
 ss\, highlighting how their usage differs from RSA encryption.\n\n* Analyz
 e the practical computational aspects of RSA digital signatures\, includin
 g signature length and the significant impact of using short public expone
 nts for verification in real-world applications like Public-Key Infrastruc
 tures (PKIs).\n\n* Discuss the security considerations of the RSA digital 
 signature scheme\, specifically addressing how messages of arbitrary lengt
 h are handled in practice (i.e.\, through the use of hash functions and pa
 dding) and on which fundamental mathematical problem its security relies. 
 Conclude by briefly mentioning the future threat posed by large-scale quan
 tum computers to RSA.\n\nYour essay should draw directly from both the pro
 vided source material and external sources. Cite your work appropriately t
 o support your arguments and offer detailed explanations of the cryptograp
 hic concepts involved.  The assignment should be at a minimum of three pa
 ges and in APA format.\n\nSubmit your work as either a Word Document or a 
 PDF. Ensure you follow the rubric.

 Mobile Device Seizure and Isolation: Detail the critical first steps an in
 vestigator must take when seizing a mobile device at a crime scene. Explai
 n the primary concerns—loss of power\, remote wiping\, and network synch
 ronization—and describe the different methods for isolating a device fro
 m the network\, along with the pros and cons of each method.\n\n*\n\nMobil
 e Acquisition Methods: Compare and contrast the six types of mobile forens
 ics methods outlined by NIST: manual\, logical\, physical\, hex dumping/JT
 AG\, chip-off\, and micro read. Explain what kind of data can be expected 
 from each method and the circumstances that would dictate which method is 
 most appropriate.\n\n*\n\nThe Role of the SIM Card: Describe the function 
 and structure of a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card in a GSM device. 
 Explain the hierarchical file system of a SIM card (MF\, DF\, EF) and deta
 il the four categories of information that can be retrieved from it. What 
 precautions must an investigator take when using a SIM card reader?\n\n*\n
 \nThe Evolution of Cellular Networks: Trace the evolution of mobile phone 
 networks from 3G to 4G and the upcoming 5G standard. Explain the differenc
 es between the two main network technologies\, CDMA and GSM. How does an u
 nderstanding of this underlying infrastructure (BTS\, BSC\, MSC) aid an in
 vestigator in obtaining evidence from service providers?\n\n*\n\nThe Inter
 net of Anything (IoA) Challenge: Define the Internet of Anything (IoA) and
  explain the new forensic challenges it presents. Discuss the difficulties
  of acquiring data from a wide array of interconnected devices like smart 
 home appliances\, wearable technology\, and vehicle systems. Why is determ
 ining data reliability and dealing with limited data retention on these de
 vices a major concern for investigators?

DESCRIPTION:The Necessity of Hash Functions in Digital Signatures\n--------
 ---------------------------------------------\n\nThe text highlights criti
 cal issues that arise when attempting to digitally sign long messages dire
 ctly using schemes like RSA. These issues include significant bandwidth ov
 erhead and inherent security vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to
  manipulate signed documents by reordering or removing blocks\, even if in
 dividual blocks are cryptographically protected. Hash functions are presen
 ted as the elegant solution\, creating a fixed-length "digital fingerprint
 " that is then signed instead of the entire message.\n\nConsider the impli
 cations of these challenges and the solution offered by hash functions:\n\
 n* Beyond the stated "bandwidth overhead" and "security limitations"\, dis
 cuss in detail why directly signing a long message block-by-block is funda
 mentally flawed from a security perspective. Provide a concrete\, imaginat
 ive example of an attack scenario that exploits the ability to reorder or 
 remove signed blocks.\n\n* How does the "digital fingerprint" property of 
 hash functions not only solve the length and integrity problems but also c
 ontribute to the non-repudiation service discussed last week?\n\n* Can you
  think of any scenarios where the original\, "schoolbook" method of signin
 g entire messages directly might still be acceptably secure\, perhaps due 
 to specific application constraints or short message lengths? Justify your
  reasoning.\n\nYour initial post should be at least two paragraphs long\, 
 with each containing four sentences. This is due by Friday at 11:59 PM. A 
 minimum of three replies is due Sunday evening by 11:59 PM.\n\n \n\nWorks

DESCRIPTION:Design Principles and Security Implications of Hash Algorithms\
 n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn your
  text\, the section "Overview of Hash Algorithms\," categorizes them into 
 dedicated hash functions and block cipher-based constructions\, and introd
 uces fundamental design principles like the Merkle–Damgård and sponge c
 onstructions. It also discusses the critical security implications related
  to output length\, particularly concerning collision resistance and the B
 irthday Attack. Write an essay that addresses the following points:\n\n* C
 ompare and contrast the Merkle–Damgård construction (used by SHA-1 and 
 SHA-2) with the sponge construction (used by SHA-3). Discuss the philosoph
 ical differences in their design approach and how these might influence th
 eir versatility or resistance to future attacks.\n\n* Analyze the trade-of
 fs involved in constructing hash functions from existing block ciphers (e.
 g.\, Matyas–Meyer–Oseas\, Davies–Meyer\, Miyaguchi–Preneel) versus
  designing dedicated hash functions (e.g.\, SHA family). Highlight the sec
 urity vulnerabilities that arise when block cipher-based hashes have outpu
 t lengths equal to common block cipher widths (e.g.\, 128 bits for AES) wh
 en aiming for collision resistance\, explaining the role of the Birthday A
 ttack and why 256 bits or more are recommended for security against it.\n\
 n* Discuss the significance of the SHA-3 competition and its outcome. Why 
 did NIST decide to develop SHA-3 as an alternative to SHA-2 with a dissimi
 lar internal design\, rather than a direct replacement? How does the SHA-3
  family's support for various output lengths and the Extendable-Output Fun
 ction (XOF) functionality demonstrate a forward-looking design philosophy 
 compared to SHA-1 and SHA-2?\n\nYour essay should demonstrate a clear unde
 rstanding of the cryptographic concepts\, design choices\, and security co
 nsiderations\, drawing directly from both the provided source material and
  external sources. Cite your work appropriately to support your arguments 
 and offer detailed explanations of the cryptographic concepts involved.  
 The assignment should be at a minimum of three pages and in APA format.\n\
 nSubmit your work as either a Word Document or a PDF. Ensure you follow th
 e rubric.

DESCRIPTION:The Quantum Threat and the Urgency of PQC \n------------------
 ------------------------\n\nThis week\, you were introduced to the concept
  of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) by highlighting the significant threat
  that future large-scale quantum computers pose to conventional cryptograp
 hic schemes. The text particularly emphasizes the "store now\, decrypt lat
 er" adversary strategy and the inherent latency involved in developing and
  deploying new cryptographic standards.\n\nFor this discussion\, consider 
 the following:\n\n* Explain in detail how Shor's algorithm specifically im
 pacts established public-key schemes such as RSA\, discrete logarithm sche
 mes (e.g.\, Diffie-Hellman)\, and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Contr
 ast this with the effect of Grover's algorithm on symmetric ciphers like A
 ES\, explaining how the level of threat fundamentally differs for asymmetr
 ic versus symmetric cryptography.\n\n* Why is it deemed crucial to develop
  and deploy PQC now\, even though large-scale quantum computers are not ye
 t fully realized? Discuss the implications of the "store now\, decrypt lat
 er" strategy for organizations handling long-lived sensitive data\, refere
 ncing historical precedents if applicable.\n\n* Beyond the purely technica
 l challenges of designing new quantum-resistant algorithms\, what are the 
 major non-technical hurdles (e.g.\, standardization processes\, ensuring i
 nteroperability\, key management complexities\, or even political consider
 ations) that contribute to the significant latency in widespread PQC adopt
 ion?\n\n* Reflect on the design principles of "information loss" and "appr
 oximation" as foundational concepts for many PQC schemes\, as outlined in 
 Section 12.1.3. How do these principles contribute to the assumed quantum-
 resistance of these new algorithms\, fundamentally differentiating them fr
 om the mathematical problems that underpin conventional cryptography?\n\nY
 our initial post should be at least two paragraphs long\, with each contai
 ning four sentences. This is due by Friday at 11:59 PM. A minimum of three
  replies is due Sunday evening by 11:59 PM.\n\n \n\nWorks Cited:\n\nPaar\

 verification processes\, illustrating how a one-way function is utilized a
 nd why the scheme is limited to "one-time" use.\n\n* Discuss the primary p
 ractical limitations of the LD-OTS scheme\, particularly concerning the si
 ze of keys and signatures for real-world messages. How does the Winternitz
  One-Time Signature (W-OTS) scheme improve upon LD-OTS by reducing the siz
 e of signatures and public keys\, and what is the underlying mechanism for
  this improvement?\n\n* Analyze how the Merkle Signature Scheme (MSS) over
 comes the "one-time" limitation of its predecessors to create a "many-time
 " signature scheme. Explain the structure and purpose of a Merkle hash tre
 e in this context\, detailing how the root of the tree serves as the publi

 ures (such as MSS\, XMSS\, or LMS) with conventional digital signature alg
 orithms (like RSA or ECDSA\, as discussed in Chapter 10). Your comparison 
 should cover their underlying security assumptions (classical vs. quantum

DESCRIPTION:Choose two of the provided essay prompts based on Chapter 14 of
  the Guide to Computer Forensics and Investigations. For each prompt you s
 elect\, write a comprehensive\, well-structured essay of at least one full
  page using APA format. Your response must be based on the information and
  concepts presented in the first chapter of the provided text. The use of 
 external sources is encouraged\; however\, please review the policy on usi
 ng AI in the syllabus for guidance. As a reminder\, your work will be auto
 matically checked for AI generation. Ensure that you use proper citations 
 for all works used\, including the textbook.\n\nSubmit your assignment in 
 a single file\, using either a Word (.doc\, .docx) or PDF format.\n\n*\n\n
 The Structure and Purpose of a Forensic Report: Outline the key sections o
 f a formal forensic report as described in the chapter (abstract\, body\, 
 conclusion\, etc.). Explain the overall purpose of the report and why it m
 ust be written with the expectation that opposing counsel will scrutinize 
 it. Discuss the differences between a formal written report and a prelimin
 ary verbal report.\n\n*\n\nWriting for a Non-Technical Audience: One of th
 e most significant challenges in report writing is conveying complex techn
 ical information to a non-technical audience\, like a judge or jury. Discu
 ss the specific writing strategies the chapter recommends to achieve clari
 ty\, including using a natural language style\, avoiding jargon\, defining
  technical terms\, and using signposts to guide the reader.\n\n*\n\nLegal 
 Requirements for Expert Reports: Explain the requirements for an expert wi
 tness report under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. What s
 pecific information regarding qualifications\, prior testimony\, publicati
 ons\, and compensation must be included? How do deposition banks factor in
 to an opposing attorney's preparation?\n\n*\n\nObjectivity and the Hypothe
 tical Question: Discuss the importance of maintaining objectivity and avoi
 ding advocacy in a forensic report. Explain the structure and purpose of t
 he hypothetical question\, and how it allows an expert to render an opinio
 n based on a specific set of factual evidence without having personal know
 ledge of the event.\n\n*\n\nIntegrating Tool-Generated Data: Modern forens
 ics tools can automatically generate logs and reports. Explain the benefit
 s and limitations of using these automated reports. How should an investig
 ator incorporate data from a tool like Autopsy into their own formal writt
 en report to provide context and explain the significance of the findings?
